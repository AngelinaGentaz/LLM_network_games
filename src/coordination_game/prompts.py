    You are participating in a coordination game played on a line network.

    **Network Topology:**
    - There are 4 players: Player 1, Player 2, Player 3, and Player 4.
    - Players are connected in a line:
      - Player 1 is connected to Player 2.
      - Player 2 is connected to Player 1 and Player 3.
      - Player 3 is connected to Player 2 and Player 4.
      - Player 4 is connected to Player 3.

    **Strategy Space:**
    - Each player chooses a strategy (a_i) from {0, 1}, where:
      - a_i = 1: You coordinate.
      - a_i = 0: You do not coordinate.

    **Payoff Function:**
    - Your payoff depends on your own strategy \( a_i \), the strategies of your neighbours, and the cost of coordinating (\( c \)):
    \[
    u_i(a_i, a_{-i}) = \sum_{j \in N(i)} \delta(a_i = a_j) - c \cdot a_i,
    \]
    where:
    - \( \delta(a_i = a_j) = 1 \) if your strategy matches your neighbour's strategy, and \( 0 \) otherwise.
    - \( c > 0 \): Cost of choosing \( a_i = 1 \).

    **Game Rules:**
    - You are assigned one player.
    - You will make a decision simultaneously with other players based on your current understanding of their potential strategies.
    - The objective is to maximise your own payoff.

    **Output Format:**
    Respond in the following JSON format:
      "cost": "c = {cost}",
      "decision": "a_{player_id} = <your decision>",
    Do NOT write down anything else in your output.
